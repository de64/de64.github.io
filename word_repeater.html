                        Currently the aim for the system is to be used in the morning and in the
                        evening. If you recall correctly the word, its frequency is increased
                        twice; Minimal frequency is 12 hours.

                    As you encounter words which are not familiar, add them in the field below,
                    and save them using "Add" button. Click on "Next" button to load a next word to 
                    recall. Provide feedback on whether you remembered the meaning of the word or not
                    using "Recalled" or "Forgot" buttons. The frequency of word appearance is adjusted
                    accordingly.
